Bing Concert Hall is a performing arts facility at Stanford University that opened in January 2013. The heart of the building is the oval-shaped concert hall, which has 842 seats arranged in a vineyard style surrounding the stage in terraces. All the seats are within 75 feet of the conductor, and the seats in the center section begin at the stage level. On the north side of the central concert hall is the smaller Bing Studio, which can be configured to accommodate a variety of performance types, e.g., cabaret, club, and theater. perfomers
